Tutorial
1. Extract zip folder into any Directory you desire.
2. In Directory, cut or copy & paste Microphone Status - Shortcut into Desktop
3. Double click the shortcut to open.
4. Now in OBS, create a new source to capture the window showing a picture.
5. Default keys are K, and L. (reason behind this is because I use those keys to Mute&Unmute)
(Doesn't matter which key you press, they both are just meant to change the picture while at the same time
muting and unmuting microphone)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
To change the keys, just open the .py file into notepad, and change keys there.

Thank you for trying out my first published project!
Consider a tip maybe? (don't worry if you don't, you just being here means enough to me <3)
